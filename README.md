    Anika Morris's College Resume
    Anika is a well-rounded student with interests in art, service learning, and programming.
    
        In her freshman year, Anika decided to enter Berkeley High School's Poetry Out Loud
        competition. She won with "Hysteria" by Dionisio D. Martinez. She then moved on to the county
        competition, and, after winning that, she went all the way to Sacramento for the statewide
        competition. Unfortunately, she didn't make it to Nationals, but the experience truly
        solidified her love of poetry.
        
        During the summer between her freshman and sophomore years, Anika traveled to Peru with
        Visions Service Adventures with the goals of making a small difference in the world by
        helping those with less resources, experiencing a different culture, and making memories
        to last a lifetime. The group helped build irrigation systems for crops, construct a fence
        in a schoolyard to make sure kids didn't run into the road, and completed the second story
        of a school. She had an amazing time and made friends on that trip that she still talks to
        today.
        
        Anika took AP Computer Science Principles her sophomore year. One day, someone came into her
        class to talk to them about a summer program called Make School. It was an 8-week program 
        that taught young developers how to make apps. She decided to do it. After she got used to a 
        new programming language, Anika decided to make an app the would help those newly diagnosed with 
        Type 1 Diabetes do their insulin calculations. Her younger sister, who has T1D, and her sister's 
        nurse helped her figure out the formulas needed to safely ensure that these calculations worked. 
        She presented her app at Make School's Bay Area Demo Day.
